					<h4>Takeaways</h4>

					<p>My experience with Bank of America's Design Team in 2020 was awesome. In three words, I'd say it was</p>
					
					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">Challenging</p>
					<p>Much like my time at Juvo, I had to identify my personal interests and align them with the user and company interests. Moreover, my summer was shortened to 8 weeks due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and I faced a few tech problems along the way. Despite this ultra tight timeline, these problems weren't insurmountable, and I quickly realized that a lot of what I was facing is part of the process of adjusting to remote work.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 64px !important;">As a piece of reflection after my experience, I would tell my future self: lean on your teammates and their skills, and ask for feedback often, especially when working remotely. It can become easy to just fall into your own work when you're not in the office, but I found that remembering to keep communication channels open and asking for feedback/collaboration is just one way of keeping myself up to speed and motivated.</p>

					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">Rewarding</p>
					<p>During my experience, I learned how to lead and manage a product life cycle, to go from understanding the user to refining prototypes only in a matter of weeks. I solidified my understanding of Sketch with CraftManager and an internal design system, with the entire InVision suite. I also became familiar with UserZoom, and designed multiple UX research survey screeners and questionnaires. I participated in multiple design sprints, one that I actually led myself for designers and partners on the Merrill platform business side. The list of learnings  goes on and on.</p>

					<p>A piece of advice on being an experience designer at a bank, from my manager that has stuck with me is to "don't worry about the legal restrictions or boundaries first. Come up with the perfect, out-of-this-world solution, and we'll work together to bring it down a notch or two so it's compliant."</p>

					<p style="margin-bottom: 64px !important;">I found this advice to be profound and impactful, and it made my entire experience more rewarding. Innovation is not possible without coloring outside the lines, without seriously picking apart what clients or users want and need in an experience. And then, as a designer, finding a way to make it happen.</p>

					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">Amazing</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 64px !important;">My manager and teammates were highly responsive and gave me insightful and clear feedback, every step of the way. I'm grateful that my work came together of course—I unveiled two awesome widget concepts to the design org. But I'm also deeply grateful have bonded with the XD intern cohort and the rest of the design org, even at such a large company, and while working remotely.</p>
