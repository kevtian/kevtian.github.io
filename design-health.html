			<!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
			<div class="row adj-gutters">
				<div class="col-lg-9 offset-lg-1 col-md-6 offset-md-2 col-sm-10 offset-sm-1">
					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">Client desired outcome</p>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom: 64px !important">"Nurses need a safer, more efficient, and more reliable way to interact with IV lines in the critical care setting including identification and tracing to prevent medical error."</h4>

			<!-- WORKFLOW -->
			<div class="row adj-gutters">
				<div class="col-lg-5 offset-lg-3 col-md-6 offset-md-2 col-sm-11 offset-sm-1">
					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">Problem validation</p>
					<p>As a team, we know that our client desired outcome is a well-validated need.</p>
					<p>The needs statement is backed by over 100 hours of ethnographic observations in the Duke University Medical Center clinical care setting, 10+ one-on-one Registered Nurse (RN) interviews, and 70+ group interviews with experienced nurses.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 64px !important">Moreover, from intial research conducted by the team in the critical care space, over 50% of nurses interviewed are deeply unsatisfied with the status quo.</p>



					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">Status quo</p>
					<p>Currently, nurses in the ICU have to deal with transparent medical IV tubing that tangles easily.</p>
					<p>In order to safely and correctly administer fluids, nurses need to trace lines from smart pump to insertion site in a process known as line reconciliation.</p>
					<img style="width:100%; margin-bottom: 24px;" alt="Kevin Tian Duke Design Health healthcare innovation design IV tube tangle" src="images/ddhp/tangle.png">
					<p style="margin-bottom: 64px !important">This seemingly simple task becomes significantly more challenging in emergency situations, with multiple IV lines, all tangled, and no clear way to identify which line is which.</p>

			<!-- SOLUTION -->
			<div class="row adj-gutters">
				<div class="col-lg-9 offset-lg-1 col-md-6 offset-md-2 col-sm-10 offset-sm-1">
					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">The solution</p>
					<h4 style="margin-bottom: 64px !important">Illumination of medical tubing in the critical care space</h4>

					<img style="margin-bottom: 24px; width: 100%;" alt="Kevin Tian Duke Design Health healthcare innovation design illuminated IV tubing solution" src="images/ddhp/solution.png">
					<p>Our team has created this breakthrough to improve nurse workflow and bring medical technology in the critical care space up to speed. IV tubing is an opportunity space that has not seen innovation in many decades.</p>
				</div>
			</div>


			<div class="row adj-gutters">
				<div class="col-lg-5 offset-lg-3 col-md-6 offset-md-2 col-sm-11 offset-sm-1">
					<p>As you can see in the image above, the solution we propose is effective in both broad daylight and dim light conditions, significantly improving visibility of a specific IV line.</p>
					<p>The bright illumination is powered either by an ultrathin laser wire, or by LEDs. The entire illuminated IV tubing set is disposable, easy to install, and allows for nurses to tap to activate the illumination.</p>
					<p>Safety features, both technical and physical, are built into the device. They prevent the illumination lumen from staying on for longer than intended (~30 seconds), getting too hot, or piercing the inner IV tubing wall.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 64px !important;">This innovation can be customized to meet the demands of any nurse workflow. One, two, or a handful of our illuminated IV tubing sets can be used in conjunction with standard IV tubes.</p>

					<h4>Impact</h4>
					
					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">Improved nurse workflow experience</p>
					<p>Nurses now have a easy, fast, and safe method of identifying their IV lines, especially in the event of an emergency situation.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 64px !important;">The nurses interviewed by our team have unanimously expressed their preference of adapting this technology into their current workflow. Many have asked us why the technology does not currently exist and when our product will be on the market.</p>

					<h4>Takeaways</h4>

					<p>My experience with the Design Health Program has been awesome. In two words, I'd say my time has been</p>
					
					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">Eye-opening</p>
					<p>I've come to realize throughout this experience prototyping for the health care space is very different from the tech space. Some solutions simply won't fly, especially without rounds and rounds of testing, surveying, and clinical trials. This reminds me of the book I'm reading called <a href="https://www.ruinedby.design/">Ruined by Design</a>, in which Mike Monteiro exactly contrasts the ethics and moral code followed by health care workers with the seeming lack of a similar code followed by today's digital designers.</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 64px !important;">As a reflection from the experience so far, I would tell my future self: innovating in sector like health care with lots of inertia is really challenging, but possible. Through many rounds of ethnographic research and needs validation, and of course plenty of actual prototype trials and refinement, it possible to bring about change in a setting as meaningful and critical as our hospitals and intensive care units.</p>
					

					<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5); margin-bottom: 8px !important; margin-top: 32px !important;">Rewarding</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 64px !important;">The opportunity to work with medical professionals, medtech consultants, and experts from Duke's Fuqua School of Business and the Pratt School of Engineering is an opportunity I simply couldn't pass up. Through my year with the program, I've learned medical terminology and lingo and developed a critical understanding of the ins and outs of health care through the lens of the Duke Health System. I'd say these experiences are priceless, and I'm really grateful to have been exposed to them so early in my career.</p>
